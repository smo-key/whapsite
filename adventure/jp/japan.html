          <h3>You are the renowned regent of the Kamakura shogunate Hojo Tokimune, feared and respected throughout Japan.</h3><br>

          <h5 id="jp">You were born into a noble family, the son of a previous regent. All your youth, you were regaled with tales of the great deeds you would do, the fame you would win as ruler. And you have lived up to these tales. You rose quickly to power, defeating every challenger with the same raw vigor. Though by all rights the shogun himself or even the emperor should wield the power you hold, their weakness has allowed you to achieve near total control of Japan. Now you rule Japan with an iron fist, lording over the lesser lords and samurai.
          <br><br>
          Seven years ago the Mongols came to try to conquer Japan. They brought hundreds of ships and thousands of soldiers, and nearly destroyed your country. It was only the will of the gods, a great typhoon, which saved you from such foes. Since then you have realized the importance of building the Japanese armies and reinforcing the coastal defences. You have spent the last seven years consolidating the army into a force that might repel any invaders when they arrive the next time. A string of forts have been built on the coast, filled with loyal samurai and ready for anything that might come. You just hope it will be enough for the fleet which has been sighted off Japan’s coast.
          <br><br>
          With the Mongols coming ever closer, you need to start making serious decisions. Though you expected an attack eventually, the shogunate’s forces are scattered, and the troops you have available at the coast will, by all reports, be vastly outnumbered by the Mongol army. You are fortified and well situated, but your forces will not be able to last long against the invading army. It will be possible to gather a larger army, but the muster will take time as lords call on their vassals for samurai.
          <br><br>
          Do you attack the Mongols now with your smaller force, or do you fall back to gather a larger army that will have a greater chance of success?
