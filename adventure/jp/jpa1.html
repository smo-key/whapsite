          <h3>You tell your samarai to build forts all along the coast of Kyushu and especially around the city of Fukuoka, the locations where the Mongols have based most of their attacks.</h3><br>

          <h5 id="jp">Some of your soldiers complain, saying that this reinforcement is useless and that given the sheer size of their forces Mongols will easily overrun the forts. You see their logic, but you know that the best way to defend an island is to convince the civilians to help. You command the citizens to assist in the construction efforts, and though they are not happy, they know that they must either help or die.
          <br><br>
          A few weeks later the Mongol force comes into view. You can see from Nadayama Hill that it is much larger than the first invasion force. Your samarai are agitated, for they do not think that the forts will be enough. Honestly, you agree with them. Your warriors fight the Mongols’ first wave back to the boats, but they regroup and sweep through your lines.
          <br><br>
          Local priests are mingling with the troops, coming from the large shrine of Susanoo situated a few kilometers inland. You hope they will raise morale with their talk of divine aid and the glory of the Japanese people. If their claims are to be believed, through prayer to the kami deliverance from the Mongols will be achieved. You however put little value in such claims. To you the mysteries of the human mind are infinitely more fascinating than any spirits. But whatever you can do to win, you will do, as the destiny of Japan hangs in the balance in this fateful confrontation.
          <br><br></h5>
          <h3>You are defeated and the leader on the Mongols, Shinedu, takes you prisoner, sending you to Xanadu to be Kublai Khan’s personal fingernail trimmer.
          </h3>
