          <h5 id="jp">You meet the Mongols when they first land, sending waves of brave samurai against the barbarians. They have no sense of honor: rather than engage in single combat with your samurai, these Mongol curs fight in a group, cowardice holding them huddled together like dogs. Yet despite these dishonors your samurai have managed to fight off the first force of Mongols. You fought for hours in many skirmishes, each contributing to your success. They were pushed back to their ships, and though the Japanese losses are great, the invaders have lost still more men.
          <br><br>
          Now with the threat momentarily averted, you and your men have time to breathe and recuperate. You receive word that the reinforcements you so greatly need are arriving from farther inland, the muster progressing slowly. They will be here within the month, if only you can hold off the invaders for long enough. However, the troops you do have are tired from the conflict. Though the Mongols seem even more beaten down than your own samurai, if they rally and attack again you doubt your forces can fight them off for much longer without the aid of reinforcements.be enough for the fleet which has been sighted off Japan’s coast.
          <br><br>
          Local priests are mingling with the troops, coming from the large shrine of Susanoo situated a few kilometers inland. You hope they will raise morale with their talk of divine aid and the glory of the Japanese people. If their claims are to be believed, through prayer to the kami deliverance from the Mongols will be achieved. You however put little value in such claims. To you the mysteries of the human mind are infinitely more fascinating than any spirits. But whatever you can do to win, you will do, as the destiny of Japan hangs in the balance in this fateful confrontation.
          <br><br>
          What do you do? Do you tell your samarai to build forts, or do you command your samarai to pray to Susanoo, who might save Japan again?
