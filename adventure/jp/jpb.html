          <h5 id="jp">Your loyal Japanese citizens, having been evacuated from the present danger, help establish a camp in which you wait for more reinforcements. One runner comes with word from Kyoto, promising 50,000 men will soon arrive. But back in Kyoto the shogun is building up an army of 300,000 that should be ready within two years. Pleased with the message, you dispatch a spy to see what the Mongols are doing and sit back to relax as your army builds up its fortifications
          <br><br>
          One week later your spy comes back with grim reports. He claims that the Mongols have at least 100,000 men and you know that the Mongols are great at fighting even with lesser numbers. You only have around 40,000 to 60,000 troops, and you fear that the Japanese stand no chance against the greater numbers. As you worry over your slim chances of surviving grows, the samurai feel your nervousness, becoming more and more agitated.
          <br><br>
          The next week your reinforcements of 50,000 men march into your camp ready to fight. Every soldier’s morale is boosted with the knowledge that they outnumbered the invaders. You give great motivational speeches and hope that you might be able to win.
          <br><br>
          One of your trusted advisors recommends that you attack the Mongols in Fukuoka. You realize that a surprise attack might be able to overcome the invasion before they get any farther into Japan. However, if the Mongols have properly built up defences around the city, there would be no hope of your army breaking through. You and all of Japan would fall and the Mongols would take over unopposed. But if you wait too long to attack, more soldiers might come over from China and once more outnumber you. 
          <br><br>
          What do you do? Do you move and attack the Mongols now? Or do you wait for the Mongols to come to you?
